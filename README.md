# sporty-shoes-shopping

This repo contains the project for the Simplilearn Advanced Java Development course (also known as
Implement Frameworks the DevOps way).

The project task was to create an e-commerce website for Sporty Shoes. The [writeup](./WRITEUP.md)
describes the application I created, and the [screenshots](./SCREENSHOTS.md) illustrate how the
application works.
